With the GSC environment and its curriculum, I was exposed to diverse perspectives and gained a better understanding of many aspects of Japanese culture, including history, livelihood, and society, from several professors in the classroom, and from Japanese friends I made here. Being an exchange student has not only broadened my perception towards Japanese culture, but also led me to recognize how its history and evolution over time affects the modern world. Life at GSC changed my life more than I expected, both academically and individually. I have grown as a person while developing relationships with many incredible individuals that have become my good friends, creating memories that I will continue to cherish for life. Japan is not what you imagine until you have experienced it &#9786;</p>

Obtaining this opportunity at AGU allowed me to broaden my horizons and truly gave me the experience of a lifetime. I was able to extend and deepen my existing interest in the country and culture - not only through GSC's diverse range of courses, but also through the fun social activities held for the student community. As a cultural studies student aiming to experience, explore and understand world cultures, my study at Aoyama Gakuin University truly helped me appreciate Japan's exquisite blend of traditional and ultramodern cultures. Throughout my stay, I was always warmly welcomed by all the amiable staff and my fellow peers. The community made me feel right at home and always actively reached out to offer guidance and assistance. I owe a lot to my fulfilling time here - gaining lifelong friends, and developing deeper intercultural awareness by immersing myself in a foreign environment. In short, my exchange has been one of, if not the best experience of my undergraduate years.</p>

I felt at home from the day I arrived. I was able to make many friends, from not only Japan but all around the world. The staff, faculty members and local students welcomed me warmly like an old friend and supported me more than I could ever have asked for.<br>
Studying at Aoyama Gakuin University for a year was a life-changing experience for me. It is a memory I definitely will happily carry in my heart forever. I feel like I not only studied, but also grew as a person, learning so much about myself and the world around me, while gaining competence money cannot buy. My understanding of Japanese culture and language has improved enormously as well, just like I hoped for! I am glad I had the opportunity to study at Aoyama Gakuin University and I can happily recommend it to anyone whose dream is to study in Japan.</p>

                                  <p class="voice">Studying abroad in Japan was a dream of mine since my freshman year in college. My grandfather told me many stories about Japan; a vibrant country rich in traditions, and I wanted to fully understand that country.<br>
                                      Aoyama Gakuin University proved to be a great place to do that. The classes in Japanese culture helped me understand the beauty in nature and people. These courses also helped me grasp how often we forget the most important aspects of ourselves. Similarly, the classes in Japanese Geography made me realize the diversity of Japan as a nation. Moreover, learning about the Great East Japan earthquake helped me comprehend how resilient the Japanese people are, and the hardships they have overcome.<br>
                                      To those seeking to study abroad in Japan, I would advise them not to choose Japan based on anime or manga. Instead, choose Japan, because of the Japanese people who continue to be vibrant. Come to Japan to understand a society that has faced many challenges and overcome them. Finally, come to Japan so you can experience for yourself how great the Japanese culture is.

                                      As an exchange student, there are two mandatory courses ("Japanese," and "Japanese Culture and Society"). Other than that, we can enroll in any subject we are interested in. The most interesting for me were classes on Japanese culture. Through these classes, we were able to explore various forms of Japanese culture.<br>
                                      At GSC, a Japanese "tutor" (someone like a "buddy") is assigned to each exchange student. She or he helps you in everything from studies to your life in Japan. This friendly system really made me feel at home. It was also a great experience to study in the same class with Japanese students, making new friends and practicing Japanese with them.<br>
                                      At GSC, everyone around me made me feel warm and secure. Along with the great GSC staffs, and a very kind advisor, I made many great friends.<br>
                                      I loved everything about my stay at GSC, and I think my one-year experience in Japan will be one of the most precious memories of my life.</p>

If you're a student thinking about opportunities abroad, or a person who just can't stop thinking about Japan, then please read on because this is for You. For starters, Aoyama Gakuin University (AGU) is about true Japanese culture from start to finish. Believe me when I say that you will get exactly what you see. So what is it that you're getting? Well in AGU, they have fashioned a curriculum that pioneers a synergy of traditional culture and modernization.<br>
                                      Throughout my experience there, lectures have exposed me directly to Japanese Culture through advanced teaching-facilities. There, we were taught by actual Masters, some of whom are as young as we are. But if you're like me and prefer social activities more, don't worry. The School of Global studies and Collaboration (GSC) frequently hosts student activities that let you interact with the locals, specifically designed for international students. So, if I still have your attention, here's my message: I know you don't get many chances when it comes to studying abroad, but from one to the other, do yourself a favor and enroll here. The GSC experience will make you so much richer than anywhere else can.

I would recommend this program to anyone seeking a challenging learning opportunity, personal growth, friendships, and of course, memories that will last a lifetime.

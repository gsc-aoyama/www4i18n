## The School of Global Studies and Collaboration (GSC)

### Our Mission:
The School of Global Studies and Collaboration (GSC) opened its doors in April 2015, becoming AGUâ€™s 10th faculty. Our mission is to cultivate human resources who possess both a strong educational background and high level of specialized knowledge in the social sciences, with a focus on the rapidly growing Southeast Asia region. We encourage students to acquire knowledge and skills that will enable them to share perspectives and collaborate with others. It is our hope for our students to develop awareness as a global citizen respecting diversity and coexistence, and to have the willingness to serve the society.

### Curriculum:
GSC takes an interdisciplinary curricular approach. Four clusters are based on the social sciences: Media/Spatial Information, Sociology, Collaboration and Business. By pursuing studies in these four areas simultaneously, it is possible for students to acquire the knowledge required to pursue activities in a wide range of different fields.

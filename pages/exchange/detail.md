## Japan Studies Courses

The Japan Studies Courses offer a variety of programs that allow students to immerse themselves in Japan together with their domestic counterparts. Students can choose from a selection of courses covering business, culture, history, sociology, and spatial information, where they will learn from a collection of renowned researchers, artists, and policy analysts about issues in each field. Some of the courses provide opportunities for hands-on experiences of traditional and contemporary Japanese culture, from Noh and Kabuki to pop culture and robotics, inside and outside of the classroom.
